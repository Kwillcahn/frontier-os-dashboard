## 🏗️ Architecture

The project follows a standard enterprise-grade frontend structure:

- `/components`: Atomic UI elements and composite layout blocks.
- `/types`: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for consistent data handling.
- `/constants`: Configuration, mock data, and static theme definitions.
- `App.tsx`: Main layout coordinator.
